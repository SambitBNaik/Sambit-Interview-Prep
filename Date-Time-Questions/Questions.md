## Bonus Tips for Solving These Scenarios

1. **Always use `new Date()` carefully** - It can be timezone-dependent
2. **Consider edge cases**: leap years, month-end dates, DST transitions
3. **Use UTC when appropriate** - Prevents timezone-related bugs
4. **Libraries to consider**: date-fns, moment.js (legacy), dayjs, luxon
5. **Test with different timezones** - Use `Intl` API for timezone handling
6. **Remember months are 0-indexed** - January is 0, December is 11
7. **Account for leap seconds** - Rare but important for high-precision apps
8. **Validate user input** - Invalid dates can cause unexpected behavior
